Don't Find the Rat
Don't Find the Rat is a fun and strategic tile-placement game built in Java. 
Inspired by Alex Cheddar's "Don't Find the Fox," this game challenges players to avoid forming a specific pattern on a 4x4 grid. 
It's a simple yet engaging way to test your logic and planning skills.


How the Game Works

Game Setup:
- The game board is a 4x4 grid.
- The main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) is pre-filled with the letter 'A'.
- A randomized set of tiles, consisting of:
- 5 'R's,
- 5 'T's,
- 2 additional 'A's, is shuffled and placed on the remaining grid cells.

The Objective:
-The goal is not to spell "RAT" anywhere on the board:
-Horizontally (across rows),
-Vertically (down columns),
-Diagonally (on either diagonal).

Game Logic:
- The tiles are placed randomly.
- After setup, the program checks the grid for any occurrence of "RAT."
- If "RAT" is detected, the game outputs a message letting you know.

Game Output:
The grid is displayed.
A message indicates whether "RAT" was found or not.
